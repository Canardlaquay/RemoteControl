Hello fellow visitor !
I present you my project, a Remote Control Server, which works by sending
very simple strings, whose does simple commands.
It can easily be used by any language (programming, heh.), because it's
using sockets.
For a concrete example, in python, I send the string like this:
            Remote_Socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            Remote_Socket.connect((ipAdressofRemoteHost,portOfRemoteHost))
            Remote_Socket.send("query")

On the server, we handle the query. You have a XML config file, created
at the start of the process. You can check a basic one at the root of the repo.
You can easily add commands there, but I'll explain more when it will be fully working.

For the moment, I only focus Windows, because nearly everything can be
done by commands on Unix systems. It is already included, but does
not return anything for the moment, I'll focus on this later.
I included iTunes remote control, i'll use the library at the fullest later.

If any information/help needed, contact me @ Mathysleleu[at]gmail(dot)com !

TODO:
                 - Refresh public adress at every start
                 - Make commands return something
                 - Add more librairies !
