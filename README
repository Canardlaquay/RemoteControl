Hello fellow visitor !
I present you my project, a Remote Control Server, which works by sending
very simple strings, whose does simple commands.
It can easily be used by any language (programming, heh.), because it's
using sockets.
For a concrete example, in python, I send the string like this:
            Remote_Socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            Remote_Socket.connect((ipAdressofRemoteHost,portOfRemoteHost))
            Remote_Socket.send("query")

On the server, we handle the query. You have a XML config file, created
at the start of the process. You can easily add commands there,
I'll explain more when it will be working.

For the moment, it works better on linux, because it doesn't crash
if the process doesn't exist. This is an early alpha0.0.0.1, don't
expect this to be done and usefull.

If any help needed, contact me @ Mathysleleu[at]gmail(dot)com !
